# Azure_HDInsight_Mini

In this mini-project, you'll use Azure HDInsight to set up a Spark cluster, then user Azure Storage Explorer to provision it with a Jupyter Notebook. You'll get experience working with Azure Blob Storage, and you'll make sure you delete your cluster to avoid incurring unnecessary charges. 

We recommend you do this entire mini-project in one sitting - as you will incur charges for as long as your cluster is active.

You will complete four different exercises in this mini-project. 

When you're finished, please submit a link to GitHub containing the following deliverables: 

- A Jupyter Notebook with code to achieve stated objective in each cell
- A PPT/Word-doc with screenshots of each step as performed according to this lab
- Make sure you delete your cluster
